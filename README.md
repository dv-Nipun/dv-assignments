# Advanced Password Generator
This code generates a random password of varying length while excluding certain letters read from external files.

## Running the Code

1. Save the code in a Python file, such as `password_generator.py`.
2. Create two files, "Place.csv" and "Name.csv", and populate them with letters you want to exclude from the generated password.
3. Place the Python file and the two CSV files in the same directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
